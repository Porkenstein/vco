missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_tretch	A large pillar of dark-green light pulses forth from the Tower of Gorgoth and smashes into the Chaos Moon. Tidal waves of entropic energy pulse through the atmosphere, and Morskrit disgorges its precious gifts. Tretch groans with frustration as the shower of meteors crashes somewhere far to the north, well away from the slopes of Crookback Mountain, as promised. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his raiders and sets out to claim the precious warpstone before someone else gets to it first.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	Curses! Vampires from the Silver Pinnacle have reached the impact crater of what has to be one of the largest warpstone meteors Tretch has ever seen. No doubt they seek to harvest the precious substance for some unholy spell. Unacceptable! With a slash of his tail, Tretch orders his Stormvermin forward. The dead will know to fear Clan Rictus, yes-yes!	false

missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	The location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of a captured Vampire Admiral, whose ship had floundered on Cathay's treacherous coast.\\n\\n“You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Vampire spat, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\\n\\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster. Almost as soon as he’d ordered his spies to find Darkblade’s location, word returned that the Druchii tyrant was in the area, but about to board his Black Ark back to Naggaroth. He cannot be allowed to escape!	false
