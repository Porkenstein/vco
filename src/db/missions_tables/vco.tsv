vco_custom_quest_tretch	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Moonfall	Though the bulk of the Warpstone Meteors now crash at the foot of Crookback Mountain, the Grey Seers lost control of an exceptionally large Meteor that has fallen near the Silver Pinnacle. The Lahmians have sent their deathless thralls to secure the precious substance for their own dark designs. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his finest Stormvermin and sets out to intercept the Lahmians at once.\\n	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	563	504	true	true	10.0000	1704409635	true		false
vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Shadow Meets Blade	The ranks of the Ruinous Ones were no easy feat to bring down. Norscans, Beastmen, the warhost of disciples from the Chaos Wastes itself – all the twisted Chaos-things which drew their immense strength from beyond the void, from the very realm of Chaos itself. This was the strength which Snikch’s master craved.\n\nThe location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of the Chaos warhost’s Sorcerer, who had vainly attempted to bargain for his own release. “You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Sorcerer shrieked, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\n\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster. Almost as soon as he’d ordered his spies to find Darkblade’s location, word returned that the Druchii tyrant was in the area, but about to board his Black Ark back to Naggaroth. He cannot be allowed to escape!	skv/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	true	Quest	wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	907	469	true	true	10.0000	1536102747	false	Success!
